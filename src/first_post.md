# Introduction

This is AncientStraits. This is my first blog post to test my
static site generator.

This is going to be a very long post for a reason.

# List

I had to:
1. Do the first thing
1. Do the first + 1 thing
1. Do the last thing
1. Do the second-last thing

## Why did I have to do the second-last thing after the last thing?

It is all because of:
* This reason,
* This other reason,
* And this final reason.

# Code

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    printf();
}
```
